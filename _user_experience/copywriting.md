Goal
---
Be able to develop a cohesive strategy for textual communication for a web product that considers audience and brand.

Description
---
While we've got enough on our plates and would sometimes just like to leave the task to our clients, design is, at its heart, communication, and designing effectively means making considered decisions with copy.

Readings
---
[Writing for Designers](https://alistapart.com/article/writing-for-designers-excerpt): An overview of how to methodically develop an approach to your copywriting within a project's context.

Resources/Exercises
---
[PlainLanguage.gov](https://www.plainlanguage.gov/): Plain language, writing in the simplest possible terms for the sake of clarity and reaching the broadest audience, is an important aspect of accessibility. The content here is more oriented towards government agencies looking to be compliant, but it's never bad to create a more inclusive experience for everyone.

Proof of Mastery
---
**In Interview Process:**
The easiest proof-of-concept for an applicant would be clear correspondence and descriptive copy in their portfolios.
**Badge:**
(WiP â€” but perhaps the presentation of a clear content/copy strategy for a given project whether the web project is for Gaslight or not.)
